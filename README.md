Aviyel is a platform for open source projects to build, activate and grow amazing communities around them. We are a full spectrum platform that supercharges 15 open source projects (25+ in the waiting list) by helping them measure, incentivise and grow their community.

Product
Measure: Community dashboard for the leadership, that unifies both code and non-code contributions and activity from across multiple platforms like GitHub, Twitter, Aviyel, Slack and Discord.
Incentivise: Rewards and recognition platform to incentivise the community using soulbound NFTs, swag, monetary rewards, tokens and grants. 250+ soulbound NFTs were minted on our Product Hunt launch day.
